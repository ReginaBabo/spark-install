#Introduction 
This python script is intended to provide a smooth, cross-platform installation experience
for Spark.

#Getting Started
Python 2.7 or 3.5 is required to execute this script.  Python 3.6 does not currently work
with this script due to a bug in Python.

Running the script with no parameters will grab the latest Spark/Hadoop combination
version available.

Command line options -sv and -hv  (or --sparkversion and --hadoopversion) allow the user
to specify exactly which version pairing to use.  Invalid pairings will present the list
of valid options to the user.
